        <h1>Mikhail's page</h1>
        
        <p>Whatever you had been loolking for, seem like you've failed. <br>
        So you will have to learn about me instead. </h2>
    </header>

    <ol>Before you will continue you should know about the rules of this page!
        <li><i> Whatever happens, <b>don't</b> leave this page. It will kill your computer! At least until I will allow you to do that.
            </i></li>
        <li><i>Be patient to the author. He has to do this for the goal of exersice.</i> </li>
    </ol>

    <p>So let's start. First thing you need to know, don't hit link, until you know where they lead. It can be harmfull for you mind.
        <a href="./dont.html">Do you remember the first rule?</a>
    </p>
 
    <h4>You are still here?</h4>
    <p>Ok. Lets create some table</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Who</th>
            <th>When</th>
            <th>Why</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Me</td>
            <td>now</td>
            <td>nobody knows</td>  
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>you</td>
            <td>suprisingly also now</td>
            <td>yea, why are you here?</td>  
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>everybody else</td>
            <td>never</td>
            <td>as they don't care about</td>  
        </tr>
    </table>
