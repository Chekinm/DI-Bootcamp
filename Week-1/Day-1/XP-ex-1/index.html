            <div class="paragraph">They are often called house cats when kept as 
            indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish 
            them from other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans 
            for companionship. There are more than <span class="highlighted">seventy cat breeds</span>

            <div class="paragraph"> Present in Africa and India, the lion 
                typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent 
                in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats,
                but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at twilight. 
                A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs.
                Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions, 
                depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate 
                hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, 
                deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe
