# Challenge 1
# Ask a user for a word
# Write a program that creates a dictionary. This dictionary stores the indexes of each letter in a list.

# Make sure the letters are the keys.
# Make sure the letters are strings.
# Make sure the indexes are stored in a list and those lists are values.
# Examples

# Challenge 2
# Create a program that prints a list of the items you can afford in the store with the money you have in your wallet.
# Sort the list in alphabetical order.
# Return “Nothing” if you can’t afford anything from the store.
