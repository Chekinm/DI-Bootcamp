# Using this class

# Instantiate three Cat objects using the code provided above.

# 🌟 Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog.
class Dog():

    def __init__(self, name, heigth):
# In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two 
# parameters : name and height. This function instantiates 
# two attributes, which values are the parameters.

# Create a method called bark that prints the following string 
# “<dog_name> goes woof!”.

# 🌟 Exercise 3 : Who’s The Song Producer?
# Instructions
# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
# Create an object, for example:
class Song():

    def __init__(self, lyrics):
        self.lyrics = lyrics   
    
    def sing_me_a_song(self):
        print(*self.lyrics, sep='\n')


stairway= Song(["There’s a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she’s buying a stairway to heaven"])


# Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:

stairway.sing_me_a_song()


# Exercise 4 : Afternoon At The Zoo
# Instructions
# Create a class called Zoo.

# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter:
#  zoo_name.

        self.animals = []

# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) 
# and name (name of the zoo).
# Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter 
# new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals 
# list as long as it isn’t already in the list.
    def add_animal(self, new_animal):
        if new_animal not in self.animals:
            self.animals.append(new_animal)



# Create a method called get_animals that prints all the 
# animals of the zoo.

    def get_animals(self):
        print(*self.animals, sep='\n')

# animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list 
# and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.

            print(f'we do not have {sold_animal} in our zoo.')
# Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals 
# alphabetically and groups them together based on their 
# first letter.
# Example

#     2: ["Baboon", "Bear"],
#     3: ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
#     4: ['Eel', 'Emu']
# }
# Create a method called get_groups that prints the animal/animals inside each group.
    def get_groups(self):
        for key in self.dict_animals:
            print(self.dict_animals[key])
# Create an object called ramat_gan_safari and call all the methods.

ramat_gan_safari = Zoo('Ramatgan Safari')

# try do sell anumal which doesn't exist
ramat_gan_safari.sell_animal('Mouse')
# sell existing animal
ramat_gan_safari.sell_animal('Lyon')
ramat_gan_safari.sort_animals()

# Tip: The zookeeper is the one who will use this class.
# Example
# Which animal should we add to the zoo --> Giraffe
# x.add_animal(Giraffe)
